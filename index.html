        <h2>tl;dr</h2>
        <p>
            My name is Abdullah Palaz. I am an <b>AI Engineer</b>. I do a lot of stuff, ranging from training and deploying models to creating web applications
            that uses those models. I graduated from Hacettepe University in June 2023.
            I write <b>Python</b> as well as JavaScript, HTML, CSS.
            I love <b>learning</b> and I am good at it, and I do <b>grasp</b> things very <b>fast</b>.
            I have been working at <a href="https://curiosity.tech/">Curiosity Technology</a> since September 2023.

            <li>I sometimes write web applications with Django, sometimes using the very API I've created.</li>
            <li>I sometimes try to make our methods to harness power of AI (such as RAG) more efficient and more effective.</li>
        </ul>

            This website is actually <a href="http://bettermotherfuckingwebsite.com/">this website</a>.
            I thank the creators of that website: <a href="https://twitter.com/drew_mc">Drew McConville</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/gabehammersmith">Gabe Hammersmith</a>.
            That website also has its own 'this website' but since the creators of my website's 'this website' probably already thanked the creator(s) of their website's 'this website' in their website (which is my website's 'this website'), I will not be thanking the creator(s) of 'this website' of my website's 'this website' specifically since I automatically thanked them by extension (also known as chain thanking).
