        <h2>tl;dr</h2>
        <p>
            My name is Abdullah Palaz. I am an <b>AI Engineer</b>. I do a lot of stuff, ranging from training and deploying models to creating web applications
            that uses those models. I graduated from Hacettepe University in June 2023.
            I write <b>Python</b> as well as JavaScript, HTML, CSS.
            I love <b>learning</b> and I am good at it, and I do <b>grasp</b> things very <b>fast</b>.
            I have been working at <a href="https://curiosity.tech/">Curiosity Technology</a> since September 2023.
        </p>
        <h2>Long version</h2>
        <h3>I don't know why you would be but if you are interested in, here are some personal information:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>I am from Turkey. I live in Turkey.</li>
            <li>I am currently (as of January 2024) 22.</li>
            <li>Thanks to video games I speak English and thanks to my university professor I speak German (A2). (I obviously speak Turkish as well.)</li>
            <li>You can probably find me at <em>any</em> social platform as <em>palazski</em> with some exceptions as <em>abdullahpalaz</em>.</li>
            <li>I feel a divine love for Fairouz, much like the love Rumi felt for Shams. You can find my playlist below my name above. I update the playlist regularly.</li>
            <li>I really like linguistics, especially etymology. I think the evolution of the languages shows us the history of the humankind in secret. But I am in no position to say anything in this topic since it is merely a hobby of mine.</li>
            <li>There is a (long dead) serial killer also named Abdullah Palaz. That is NOT me. Here is a <a target="_blank" href="https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abdullah_Palaz">Wikipedia page about him</a> (I don't know why but it is in German.).</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>What I do now</h3>
        <p>
            Currently I am working as an <b>Artificial Intelligence Engineer</b> at <a href="https://curiosity.tech/">Curiosity Technology</a>.
            Aside from <b><em>always</em></b> learning, there, I do the following stuff.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>I sometimes train LLMs.</li>
            <li>I sometimes put LLMs behind an API (this is quite fun actually, seeing them running <b><em>very</em> fast</b> is <em>the</em> joy).</li>
            <li>I sometimes write web applications with Django, sometimes using the very API I've created.</li>
            <li>I sometimes try to make our methods to harness power of AI (such as RAG) more efficient and more effective.</li>
        </ul>

            This website is actually <a href="http://bettermotherfuckingwebsite.com/">this website</a>.
            I thank the creators of that website: <a href="https://twitter.com/drew_mc">Drew McConville</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/gabehammersmith">Gabe Hammersmith</a>.
            That website also has its own 'this website' but since the creators of my website's 'this website' probably already thanked the creator(s) of their website's 'this website' in their website (which is my website's 'this website'), I will not be thanking the creator(s) of 'this website' of my website's 'this website' specifically since I automatically thanked them by extension (also known as chain thanking).
