        <h2>tl;dr</h2>
        <p>
            My name is Abdullah Palaz. I am an <b>AI Engineer</b>. I do a lot of stuff, ranging from training and deploying models to creating web applications
            that uses those models. I graduated from Hacettepe University in June 2023.
            I write <b>Python</b> as well as JavaScript, HTML, CSS.
            I love <b>learning</b> and I am good at it, and I do <b>grasp</b> things very <b>fast</b>.
            I have been working at <a href="https://curiosity.tech/">Curiosity Technology</a> since September 2023.

            <li>I sometimes try to make our methods to harness power of AI (such as RAG) more efficient and more effective.</li>
        </ul>

            This website is actually <a href="http://bettermotherfuckingwebsite.com/">this website</a>.
            I thank the creators of original website: <a href="https://twitter.com/drew_mc">Drew McConville</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/gabehammersmith">Gabe Hammersmith</a>.
            They probably thank the original original website's creator(s) in their website so it means I automatically thank them by extension hence I won't be thanking the original original website creator(s) here.
